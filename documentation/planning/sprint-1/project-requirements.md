## 3. Project Overview  
This app is a minimal, modern online ordering system for a single restaurant, designed with a strong focus on delivering a best-in-class user experience. Customers will enjoy a highly mobile-friendly web application for browsing the menu, placing orders, and checking out with ease—no login or account required, all orders are placed as guests. Restaurant staff will use a worker dashboard optimized specifically for Android tablets, ensuring fast, effortless order management during busy service. Restaurant admins will have access to a web-optimized portal for intuitive menu and business management. The MVP delivers the essential order flow and management tools for single-location restaurants, showcasing contemporary design, performance, and usability as top priorities.  
**Note:** There is no authentication or login for any user type in this MVP.

## 4. Problem Statement  
Restaurants need a simple, efficient way to accept online orders without the complexity or high fees of third-party platforms. Many existing solutions are bloated or costly and lack direct control for the business owner. Target users are:
- Restaurant customers seeking a quick, easy way to order food online for pickup or delivery, with zero friction—no registration or login required.
- Restaurant staff who need to see and process digital orders in real time.
- Restaurant owners/admins who want to maintain menus and update business details easily without technical expertise or authentication barriers.

## 5. Key Features  
- Customer-facing web app with digital menu browsing, categorized by item type; highly mobile friendly with modern, intuitive interactions.
- Ability for customers to add menu items to a cart, review selections, and adjust the cart before checkout.
- Order type selection: customer chooses “delivery” or “to-go.”
- Simple checkout process: customer provides only the minimum required info (name, phone, and address for delivery); no login or registration required.
- Restaurant worker portal optimized for Android tablets to view live incoming orders, accept or reject them, and mark them as made/ready.
- Restaurant admin portal optimized for web to create and update menu categories, add/edit/remove menu items, and update business information (name, hours, contact).
- Order status visibility and updates for staff and customers via the web interface.
- Mobile-first design for the customer app; tablet-first for worker portal; desktop-first for admin portal.
- Real-time or near real-time order updates in the worker portal.
- **No authentication for any portal. All portals are openly accessible in MVP.**
- **Only a single business/restaurant is supported.**

## 6. Modern & Polished User Experience  
A core goal of this project—despite its minimal feature set—is to deliver a truly modern, visually polished, and delightful user experience, especially for the customer and worker-facing frontends.

- **Customer UI**: The customer web app must feel contemporary, fast, and intuitive. Use a clean layout with clear hierarchy, ample white space, and touch-friendly controls. Animations and transitions should be smooth and subtle. Typography and color choices must be on-brand and accessible. The ordering flow should feel effortless and enjoyable, with real-time feedback and clear status at every step. The customer experience is designed to be highly mobile friendly, ensuring a seamless experience on any smartphone.
- **Worker UI**: The worker dashboard is optimized for Android tablets, providing a modern and highly responsive interface for rapid order triage and status changes. Large tap targets, bold status indicators, and clear notifications for new orders are required. The UI must minimize cognitive load and allow staff to process orders with minimal friction, even during busy rushes.
- **Admin UI**: The admin portal is web-optimized for desktop use, supporting intuitive management of menus and business details. It provides clear, modern forms and navigation, enabling non-technical users to make updates quickly and confidently.
- **Responsiveness & Performance**: All user interfaces must be responsive (according to their primary platforms), adapting gracefully to different device sizes. Performance is a top priority: initial load, navigation, and UI feedback must all feel instantaneous.

Modern design inspiration should be drawn from leading platforms such as Toast, Square, and BentoBox, ensuring the UI feels best-in-class and future-ready, not merely functional.
